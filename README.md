# Technical Task - Frontend

## Getting started

[Create a new repository](https://github.com/new?template_name=technical-test-frontend&template_owner=syltek&visibility=private) using this one as a template. Make sure set the repository visibility to **ðŸ”’ Private**.

</details>

Now clone the repository you just created and run the following commands to install the project dependencies and get a dev-server running:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can also run the project tests using this command:
```
npm test
```
> [!important]
> Some tests will fail if you run them right after cloning the repo; but they **should** be green after you are done with [Task 01](./docs//task-01.md)

Thats it! You are now ready to start with the [tasks](#tasks) or spend some time reading [what's included](#what-is-included-in-the-project) to get familiar with the project.

## Tasks

The test is divided in three mandatory tasks and one optional. The whole test is designed to be resolved in around three hours (not including the optional tasks).

- [ ] **1.** Technical work: filling the gaps in the auth flow. [Link](./docs/task-01.md)
- [ ] **2.** Product feature request: download all matches. [Link](./docs/task-02.md)
- [ ] **3.** Pull Request review: showing correct dates. [Link](./docs/task-03.md)
- [ ] **4.** _(optional)_ Technical work: auth refresh flow. [Link](./docs/task-04.md)

### Dos and don'ts

Every task has its own **Dos and Don'ts** section; but there are some things that are shared across all the tasks:

- You **should** commit **frequently** (even more than once per task) using **meaningful commit messages**.
- You **should** document some of the decisions you take while solving the challenge by writing them as a section on this README or as descriptions in the commit messages.
- You **should** consider using the available tooling before including an extra library or implementing your own.
- You **should** be consistent with your code-style.

## What is included in the project?

### Project structure

- `src/lib/`: Our _internal packages_. Each of this directories has an `index` which is considered its **entry-point**; no other part of the codebase should import from any given lib from a file other than the `index`.
- `src/lib/msw`: This a minimal mock server built using [msw](https://mswjs.io/docs). It allows us to simulate a realistic interaction with an API server without having to deploy anything extra. The directory includes a [README](./src/lib/msw/README.md) where you can find every endpoint we have available.
- `src/lib/api`: The data-fetching layer for the project. If you need to _talk_ with the API this is what you should be using. It has a lot of type-related goodies to make your developer experience better.
- `src/lib/api-types`: Some shared type definitions of entities returned by the API. No actual javascript here; just type definitions.
- `src/lib/auth`: Working directory and main focus of [Task 1](./docs/task-01.md).
- `src/views/`: The different views/pages of our application. These are components that take control of the **whole viewport** of the browser.

### Included 3rd-party libraries

- **[material-ui](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/)**: Component library. For simplicity and speed; always try using the available components instead of writing your own implementations.
- **[swr](https://swr.vercel.app/)**: Data-fetching library react-aware.
- **[@testing-library/react](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)**: Test framework for UI testing of React components.
- **[vitest](https://vitest.dev/api/)**: Test framework; including assertions and mocking.
- **[msw](https://mswjs.io/docs)**: A mock-server implementation that works on tests and on dev-mode; allowing us to have the same scenario for tests and development!
- **[react-router v5](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)**
- **[react](https://react.dev/reference/react)**
- **[vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)**
